# mmk-assessment

This application follows a Microservice API structure with a tech stack of Flask, Redis, Nginx. 

Testing has been done using pytest with unit tests and integration tests.

For autonomous testing, I have used Github Actions for CI/CD pipelining. The workflow file has been added. 

For deployment, I have used AWS EC2, and nginx.

For caching, redis has been implemented at server side.

The postman collection attached in the email sent, has both the APIs as mentioned in the requirements and contains sample requests for both endpoints.

Please let me know if there is anything else needed
